        <p class="paragraphs">Chess is a 2 player board-game played on 8 x 8 checkered (most of the time white and black) squares that are each given a unique coordinate. The board is always set up with a light coloured square (such as white) on the bottom right hand corner of each player. On the bottom and top sides of the board, there are the alphabetical letters assigned to each column from A to H. In chess, the columns are "files". As for the left and right sides of the chess board, each row is assigned a number from 1 to 8. The rows on the chess board are called "ranks". Chess is sometimes played with a chess clock which was invented when players started taking too much time to play a move. A clock would be assigned a number of minutes and when it is player's turn, their timer starts ticking down to 0. When a player makes a move, their clock stops ticking (after clicking a button, to alert the timer they have done so) and the other player's timer (both player's timers are concealed within 1 chess clock) starts ticking. Unless their are certain circumstances, the player whose timer runs down to 0 first before the game has ended with checkmate or a draw, that player immediately loses the game.</p>

        <h1>My Hobby "Chess" and Why</h1>
        <div class="line">
            <p class="paragraphs">I love chess still to this day and I have loved it for about 3 years so far. When I was 7 years old, my loving of chess had begun after my birthday when I was gifted a chess set. I didn't know how to play at the time so my dad taught me how. Shortly after that, I was hooked to the game and it was becoming my top passion, I practiced it whenever possible and an example output of this was that I won against my dad a week later after I was taught. A year later, I competed in my very first chess competition, while still young at the age of 8. I focused real hard and I turned out to be most of a success. I received 2nd place in my age group (chess name is division for "groups"). I got a small red medal but even so, my father and mother were super proud, though that was just 2 years ago. I'm sure there was a some sort of celebration but I can't rememeber what EXACTLY the reward was but that was my first chess award in my room. I began playing and playing and playing and bringing back cash, trophies and more medals and certificates. Right now, I have about 13 medals and tons of certificates and 9 trophies, I will continue on this as my passion but I will choose software engineering as my career.</p>

        <h1>My Work</h1>
        <div class="line"></div>
        <p class="paragraphs">I have worked on chess as my favourite and top passion for 3 years. Ever since the Covid-19 Pandemic Disease, I still have been playing chess tournaments with this cool chess tournament hosting, controlling and playing website called <a href="https://home.tornelo.com" target="_blank">Tornelo</a>. I have been joining Zoom Cloud HD Meetings with the arbitor (the person who hosts and controls the tournament). All players have to be in the Zoom Meeting to play to make sure there isn't any cheating, in addition to that, you must have your camera on otherwise the arbitor won't know whether there is someone behind you giving tips. Some other tournaments, like online inter-school tournaments run by Northern Star Chess, we play on Lichess, which has advanced cheat detecting methods so you don't need cameras on and/or your don't need to be in the meeting to play because they take it as disturbances when you are playing and the arbitor is helping someone else. We get online certificates that we can print and we get awards delivered straight to our home or if we choose to do so, we can come and collect them ourselves. I have received so far like 9 trophies, about 13 medals and tons of certificates.</p>

        <h1>My Inspiration</h1>
        <div class="line"></div>
        <p>My father was the one and only who inspired me on chess, taught me how to play it and taught me how to be successful in it when the time comes for when, I, compete in a chess tournament face-to-face on the chess board. Back then, chess pieces had different names to the ones they have now. The queens used to be called "Ministers", the knights were called "Horses", the rooks were called "Boats" or "Castles", the bishops were called "Elephants" and the pawns were called "Soldiers". The king, however, was still called the king before. Even though chess evolved and the names changed, it didn't stop me realising that the rules never changed, they were the same, I just had to remember the new names and play accordingly. Chess was, once again, as I say, inspired to me, by my brilliant father. Without my father, I wouldn't have known about or even played chess in my whole life.</p>
